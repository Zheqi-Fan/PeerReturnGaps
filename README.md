# 📊 PeerReturnGaps
Python implementation (INCOMPLETE version) for the quick research project: [On Cross-Stock Predictability of Peer Return Gaps in China 📄](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5417347).

We construct the Peer Return Gap (PRG), a firm-level characteristic, as the difference between the lagged returns of a focal firm’s peer group and the firm’s own lagged return. As a synthesized indicator, PRG quantifies two core components of cross-sectional stock return predictability:

1. 📈 The lagged returns of the peer group serve as a proxy for peer momentum, capturing the collective trend of firms with similar characteristics;

2. 🔄 The focal firm’s own lagged return represents a short-term reversal effect, reflecting price corrections from prior over- or under-performance.
   
Together, this metric provides a unified view of both peer group dynamics and firm-specific return patterns.
